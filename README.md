<h1 align="center"> TicTacToe </h1>

TicTacToe in C++ (Terminal only) with a little "GUI"

To execute, it needs two names. 
``./main player1 player2``

## Features:
- Two names (swap between players)
- If player-name is too long, it will automatically be cut-off for the board
- Linear, horizontal and diagonal check for wins
- Check if a Tie happend
- Can play as long as you want with asking if player wants to play again
- Well designed "GUI" - for Terminal at least :P 
- With lots of comments

## Image of the Terminal:

*(And yes, it looks like a calculator)*
